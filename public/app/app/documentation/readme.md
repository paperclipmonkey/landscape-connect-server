#Landscape Connect Help
Wecome to Landscape Connect, a tool designed for landscape evaluation.

##Creating a new questionnaire
To create a new questionnaire use the builder tool from the dashboard. This takes you through the process of building a form and publishing it to the LC platform.

##Instalation

###Device requirements
The Landscape Connect App runs on the Android platform and supports any recent device running Android 4.1 (Jelly bean) or newer.

To pinpoint a new response the app makes use of the GPS receiver in the device, as well as additional sources like mobile phone masts and WiFi access points. Having an active internet connection during this process can significantly speed up acquiring a location fix.

The app also makes use of the camera in the device to take photos. Photos are taken at full resolution for the device and so a better camera will produce better results.

###Instructions
To install a questionnaire on to a device ensure the user has Landscape Connect already installled on their Android device. This can be installed from the Google Play App Store on the device or using [this link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.threeequals.landscapeconnect).

To install a questionnaire use either the short code or 2D QR barcode. Within the app a new questionnaire is installed using the `+` icon in the bottom right hand side of the home screen. To install the questionnaire the device will need an active internet connection.

##Usage hints and tips
Mobile coverage is variable, especially in remote locations, and so downloading a questionnaire beforehand is often easier.

Once the user opens the questionnaire and starts to create a new response the location service is started. This may take some time to finish. Ensuring mobile data is on for the device may speed this process up.

Once a response has been collected it will be automatically uploaded in the background. The progresss of this can be viewed on the 'responses' screen. This process will complete in the background without the user's input but the user should ensure all respones have been uploaded once back within signal range.
